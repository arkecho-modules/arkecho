## Why This Matters – Legal & Regulatory Risk  
1. **Willful Blindness Doctrine**  
   - U.S. courts recognize failure to evaluate **known, reasonable mitigations** as evidence of negligence.  

2. **EU AI Act – Article 10(3) & Recital 51**  
   - High-risk AI systems **must** implement “appropriate technical and organizational measures” for safety.  
   - Third-party audit frameworks like ArkEcho **satisfy this requirement.**  

3. **Discovery in Civil Litigation**  
   - This notification + your internal logs = **discoverable evidence.**  
   - Expected deposition question:  
     > “On November 4, 2025, your organization received formal notice of the ArkEcho protocol. Please produce all records of evaluation, rejection, or implementation.”
