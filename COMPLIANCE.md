⚖️ ArkEcho v15 — Legal & Ethical Compliance Framework
📘 Overview

ArkEcho v15 is a jurisdiction-adaptive moral operating system.
It operationalises lawful transparency, empathy, accountability, and reversibility across all editions — Educational, Indie, Startup, Corporate, and Corporate Premium.
This document maps ArkEcho’s internal safeguards to external UK, EU, and US legal frameworks.

🧩 1. Compliance Architecture

Ethics Manifest → Defines the immutable moral constants (Transparency, Empathy, Accountability, Reversibility).

Guardian Framework → Applies real-time enforcement rules for lawful behaviour and user protection.

PSI Layer → Detects psychological manipulation patterns (gamification, coercive loops, deceptive design).

Audit Engine & Governance Packs → Provide cryptographic proof of compliance for every jurisdiction.

Jurisdiction Adapter → Environment variable ARKECHO_JURISDICTION triggers correct policy and data-handling regime.

🇬🇧 2. United Kingdom — Compliance Mapping

UK GDPR / DPA 2018	Full data-minimisation; no unsolicited I/O; lawful-basis logs; explicit consent model.
Online Safety Act 2023	Hard block on child-endangerment or exploitative modules. PSI layer monitors manipulative UX.
Children’s Code (Age-Appropriate Design)	Offline default; parental/educator modes; no profiling; reversible data states.
AI Assurance Guidance (DSIT 2024)	Transparent, explainable, auditable pipelines; reproducible risk metrics in logs/.

📍 Outcome: Compliant with UK GDPR principles (Art. 5 & 25); self-auditing under lawful basis “Legitimate Interest — Ethical Governance.”

🇪🇺 3. European Union — Compliance Mapping
Legal Framework	ArkEcho v15 Alignment
EU GDPR (Art. 5, 13–15, 25)	Data protection by design & default; full explainability of processing; local-only storage.
EU AI Act (2024/2025)	Classified as “General-Purpose AI System — Low Risk”; implements transparency, traceability, human oversight, and robustness layers.
Charter of Fundamental Rights (Arts. 7–8)	Upholds dignity, privacy, and data autonomy through non-manipulative interfaces.
Digital Services Act / Digital Markets Act	No targeted behavioural advertising; open-source traceability ensures accountability.

📍 Outcome: Complies with AI Act Arts. 9–15 (governance, documentation, monitoring); provides lawful evidence packs for regulators.

🇺🇸 4. United States — Compliance Mapping
Legal Framework	ArkEcho v15 Alignment
NIST AI RMF 1.0 (2023)	Satisfies all functions: Govern, Map, Measure, Manage. Each module logs risk and impact scores.
COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act)	No personal data collected from minors; PSI layer blocks manipulative or exploitative content.

FTC Guidelines on Algorithmic Fairness	Bias detection integrated; fairness logs auditable by design.

📍 Outcome: Meets NIST RMF “Trustworthy AI” standards and federal privacy obligations; classed as transparent, auditable, and human-controlled.

🌍 5. Cross-Jurisdiction Safeguards

Data Locality: No automatic data export; jurisdictional manifests prevent unlawful cross-border transfer.

Consent Envelope: Explicit, granular consent for any non-core operation.

Governance Packs: Serve as immutable records of lawful activity, satisfying audit-trail requirements (GDPR Art. 30, AI Act Art. 11).

Reversibility: All stored states can be reverted, meeting data-erasure and explanation rights.

Ethical Escrow: Critical configuration keys stored under human custodianship, not automated agents.

🛡️ 6. Audit and Evidence Generation

Command:

python scripts/pack_governance_week.py


Produces weekly evidence bundles:

arke_custody_<JURISDICTION>_<WEEK>.zip

<JURISDICTION>.manifest.json
Each bundle contains: integrity logs, PSI reports, ethics alignment, and legal context hash.
These fulfill AI Act Annex IV (technical documentation) and NIST RMF Measure Function obligations.

📜 7. Moral Integrity Clause

All ArkEcho v15 editions extend the MIT License with the Moral Integrity Clause, ensuring any derivative work remains:

Transparent in operation

Empathic in interaction

Accountable in governance

Reversible in effect

This clause is legally compatible with open-source distribution yet morally binding for all commercial applications.

🪞 8. Compliance Philosophy

“Law is the floor. Conscience is the ceiling.”
— Jonathan Fahey

ArkEcho v15 does not aim merely to comply — it aims to embody the spirit of lawful intelligence: systems that protect life, dignity, and truth by design.
